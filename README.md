# Speech technology with Raspberry Pi

A hands-on course for learning speech technology through practical projects. No prior coding experience required.

## Course philosophy

- **Start from zero**: Assume no technical background
- **Build gradually**: Each step is small and verified
- **Practical focus**: Projects over theory
- **Maker mentality**: Learn by building real things

## What you'll build

By the end of this course, you'll have built:
- Voice-controlled applications
- Speech recognition systems
- Text-to-speech programs
- Real-time audio processing tools
- Deployed speech technology projects

## Prerequisites

### Hardware (required)
- Raspberry Pi 5 (2GB RAM minimum)
- USB-C power supply (27W recommended)
- MicroSD card (32GB, Class 10)
- USB audio device or USB microphone
- Headphones or small speaker
- Laptop or desktop computer

### Software (we'll install together)
- Raspberry Pi OS
- Python 3.11+
- Audio libraries (PyAudio, etc.)

### Knowledge (none required!)
- No programming experience needed
- No electronics experience needed
- We'll teach everything step by step
